# ManiaReplayVisualizer
Visually compares the replay to the beatmap file

Uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and a [replay file reader](https://github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-database-reader) and [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio)

## TODO:
- Visual rework
- More Settings
- Skins
- Maybe support for other games as well (Quaver/Etterna)
- Maybe SV (unlikely)
- Maybe standard support
